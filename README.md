# Basic_Calculator

Currently Created basic calculator that can handle adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers.

Exceptions: Only Integers curently. can't do -(6*2), putting sign in front of parenthesis to represent multiplying by -1.
You MUST put a space between every operator and operand!!! EX. ( 6 + 3 ) * 2      Can't do: (6+3)*2. WIll crash!!

Future Modifications:

[]- Working with doubles.

[]- seeing -( as -1 * whatever is inside parenthesis

[]- Making it work with operators and operands right next to each other.
